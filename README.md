## Diabetes Prediction App


This repository contains a Diabetes Prediction App built using machine learning techniques. The app predicts the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on several health metrics such as glucose levels, BMI, blood pressure, and age. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset of known diabetes cases to make predictions.

Features
Prediction Model: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict diabetes risk.
Input Form: Allows users to input their health metrics for prediction.
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for backend model development.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library used for model training and prediction.
Flask: Web framework used for developing the web application.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development for creating the user interface.
